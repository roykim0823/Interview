Q. You have a basketball hoop and someone says that you can play one of two games.
   Game 1: You get one shot to make the hoop.
   Game 2: You get three shots and you have to make two of three shots.
   If p is the probability of making a particular shot, for which values of p should
   you pick one game or the other?

Solutions:
1. Pabability of winning Game 1:
	The probability of winning Game 1 is p, by definition.

2. Probability of winning Game 2:
	Let s(k, n) be the probability of making exactly k shots out of n. The probability of
	winning Game 2 is the probability of making exactly two shots out of three OR making
	all three shots. In other words:
		P(winning) = s(2, 3) + s(3, 3)

	The probability of making all three shots is 
		s(3,3) = p^3

	The probability of making exactly two shots is:
		P(making 1 and 2, and missing 3) 
		+ P(making 1 and 3, and missing 2)
		+ P(making 2 and 3, and missing 1)
		= p*p*(1-p) + p*(1-p)*p + (1-p)*p*p = 3(1-p)p^2
	
	Adding these together, we get:
		= p^3 + 3(1-p)p^2
		= p^3 + 3p^2 - 3p^3
		= 3p^2 - 2p^3

Which game should you play?
a. You should play Game 1 if P(Game 1) > P(Game 2):
	p > 3p^2 - 2p^3
	1 > 3p - 2p^2
	2p^2 - 3p + 1 > 0
	(2p - 1)(p - 1) > 0
	
	Both terms must be positive, or both must be negative. But we know p < 1, so (p - 1) < 0.
	This means both terms must be negative.
    2p - 1 < 0
	2p < 1
	p < .5

	So, we should play Game 1 if p < .5. 
	if p=0, 0.5, or 1, then p(Game 1) == P(Game 2).
	So, it doesn't matter which game we play
