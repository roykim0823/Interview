Q. There are three ants on different verices of a triangle. What is the probability of collision
   (between any two or all of them) if they start walking on the sides of the triangle?
   Assume that each ant randomly picks a direction, with either direction being equally likely to
   be chosen, and that they walk at the same speed.
Q+. Similarly, find the probability of collision with n ants on an n-vertex polygon.

Checks:
	The ants will collide if any of them are moving towards each other. So, the only way that they
	won't collide is if they are all moving in the same direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise).
	We can compute this probability and work backwards from there.

Solutions:
	Since each ant can move in two directions, and there are three ants, the probability is:
		P(clockwise) = (1/2)^3
		P(counterclockwise) = (1/2)^3
		P(same direction)= 2 * (1/2)^3 = 1/4
	
	The probability of the ants colliding is therefore the probability of the ants not moving 
	in the same direction:
		P(collision) = 1 - P(same direction) = 1 - (1/4) = 3/4
	
Solutions+:
	To generalize this to an n-vertex polygon: there are still only two ways in which the ants
	can move to avoid a collision, but there are 2^n ways they can move in total. Therefore, 
	in general, probability of collision is:
		P(clockwise) = (1/2)^n
		P(counterclockwise) = (1/2)^n
		P(same direction) = 2(1/2)^n = (1/2)^(n-1)
		P(collision) = 1 - P(same direction) = 1 - (1/2)^(n-1)
