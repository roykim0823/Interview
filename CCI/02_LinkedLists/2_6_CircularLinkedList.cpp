// Q. Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm which returns the node
//	at the beginning of the loop
/* Solution: 
1. Detect if Linked list has a loop
	FastRunner(move two nodes) and SlowRunner(move one nodes)
	FastRunner hop over SlowRunner at spot i 
	then FastRunner at spot i-1 and SlowRunner at spot i-1
  	So, they would have collided.
2. When Do They Collide
	a. SlowRunner is 0 step in the loop (takes k steps)
		-> FastRunner is k steps in to the loop
	b. Then SlowRunner is k step behind FastRunner 
		-> FastRunner is LoopSize-k step behind SlowRunner
	c. FastRunner catches up the SlowRunner 1 step at a time 
		-> it takes LoopSize-k step
	d. When FastRunner catches up SlowRunner after LoopSize-k steps
		-> They are k steps before the the start of the loop
3. Move SlowRunner at the head of list then move both of them 1 node at a time.
	-> After k steps, they will meet at the beginning of the loop

Solution2: Use hash -> same as detect a duplicated node
		   Use address of each node for the hash key
