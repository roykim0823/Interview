Challenge
1. Longest Words: Easy
Tag: string manupulation, searching
Using the C++ language, have the function LongestWord(sen) take the sen parameter being passed and return the largest word in the string. If there are two or more words that are the same length, return the first word from the string with that length. Ignore punctuation and assume sen will not be empty. 

Sample Test Cases
Input:"fun&!! time"
Output:"time"

Input:"I love dogs"
Output:"love"

2. Maximal Square: Hard
Tags: matrix, dynamic programming, Google
Using the C++ language, have the function MaximalSquare(strArr) take the strArr parameter being passed which will be a 2D matrix of 0 and 1's, and determine the area of the largest square submatrix that contains all 1's. A square submatrix is one of equal width and height, and your program should return the area of the largest submatrix that contains only 1's. For example: if strArr is ["10100", "10111", "11111", "10010"] then this looks like the following matrix: 

1 0 1 0 0
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 0 

For the input above, you can see the bolded 1's create the largest square submatrix of size 2x2, so your program should return the area which is 4. You can assume the input will not be empty.

Sample Test Cases
Input:"0111", "1111", "1111", "1111"

Output:9


Input:"0111", "1101", "0111"

Output:1

3. Pentagonal Number
Using the C++ language, have the function PentagonalNumber(num) read num which will be a positive integer and determine how many dots exist in a pentagonal shape around a center dot on the Nth iteration. For example, in the image below you can see that on the first iteration there is only a single dot, on the second iteration there are 6 dots, on the third there are 16 dots, and on the fourth there are 31 dots. 

 

Your program should return the number of dots that exist in the whole pentagon on the Nth iteration.

Input:5

Output:51

4. Correct Path: Easy
Using the C++ language, have the function CorrectPath(str) read the str parameter being passed, which will represent the movements made in a 5x5 grid of cells starting from the top left position. The characters in the input string will be entirely composed of: r, l, u, d, ?. Each of the characters stand for the direction to take within the grid, for example: r = right, l = left, u = up, d = down. Your goal is to determine what characters the question marks should be in order for a path to be created to go from the top left of the grid all the way to the bottom right without touching previously travelled on cells in the grid. 

For example: if str is "r?d?drdd" then your program should output the final correct string that will allow a path to be formed from the top left of a 5x5 grid to the bottom right. For this input, your program should therefore return the string rrdrdrdd. There will only ever be one correct path and there will always be at least one question mark within the input string. 
Sample Test Cases
Input:"???rrurdr?"

Output:"dddrrurdrd"


Input:"drdr??rrddd?"

Output:"drdruurrdddd"

5. Closet EnemyII
Using the C++ language, have the function ClosestEnemyII(strArr) read the matrix of numbers stored in strArr which will be a 2D matrix that contains only the integers 1, 0, or 2. Then from the position in the matrix where a 1 is, return the number of spaces either left, right, down, or up you must move to reach an enemy which is represented by a 2. You are able to wrap around one side of the matrix to the other as well. For example: if strArr is ["0000", "1000", "0002", "0002"] then this looks like the following: 

0 0 0 0
1 0 0 0
0 0 0 2
0 0 0 2 

For this input your program should return 2 because the closest enemy (2) is 2 spaces away from the 1 by moving left to wrap to the other side and then moving down once. The array will contain any number of 0's and 2's, but only a single 1. It may not contain any 2's at all as well, where in that case your program should return a 0. 
Sample Test Cases
Input:"000", "100", "200"

Output:1


Input:"0000", "2010", "0000", "2002"


6. Question Marks: Easy
Using the C++ language, have the function QuestionsMarks(str) take the str string parameter, which will contain single digit numbers, letters, and question marks, and check if there are exactly 3 question marks between every pair of two numbers that add up to 10. If so, then your program should return the string true, otherwise it should return the string false. If there aren't any two numbers that add up to 10 in the string, then your program should return false as well. 

For example: if str is "arrb6???4xxbl5???eee5" then your program should return true because there are exactly 3 question marks between 6 and 4, and 3 question marks between 5 and 5 at the end of the string. 
Sample Test Cases
Input:"aa6?9"

Output:"false"


Input:"acc?7??sss?3rr1??????5"

Output:"true"

Output:2
