# Good Sorting Algorithm
  - What is the most efficient sorting algorithm for each of the following situations
1. A large array whose entries are random numbers.
2. A small array of numbers.
3. A large array of numbers that is already almost sorted.
4. A large collection of integers that are drawn from a small range.
5. A large collection of numbers most of which are duplicates.
6. Stability is required, i.e., the relative order of two records that
   have the same sorting key should not be changed.

In general, quicksort is considered one of the most efficient sorting algorithms since it has
