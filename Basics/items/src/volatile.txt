// volatile variable tells the compiler that the value of the variable may change
// at any time - without any action being taken by the code the compiler finds nearby.
// -> No optimization : moving load or using register
// 1. memory-mapped peripheral registers
// 2. global variables modified by an interrupt service routine
// 3. global variables accessed by multiple taks within a multi-threaded application
